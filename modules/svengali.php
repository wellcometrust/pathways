                                <p>Du Maurier’s novel is inspired by sensational real-life stories. Among them is the case of Gabrielle Bompard in Paris in 1889. Gabrielle and her accomplice are tried for murder. In the first case of its kind, Gabrielle claimed that she had been hypnotised by her partner in crime, and had no memory of the event.</p>
                                <p>At her trial, expert witnesses for both prosecution and defence present different opinions about the power of hypnosis: can it be used to make someone commit murder against their will, or without their knowledge?</p>
