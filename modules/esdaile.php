                <p class="intro-text">  The British surgeon James Esdaile is in India, and has conducted dozens of gruesome operations: removing tumours, cutting out parts of gums, and amputating limbs, amongst many others. However what is so remarkable is that Esdaile has made the surgery pain-free by mesmerising patients before operating.</p>
