                        </header>

                        <p>Braid has a radical new theory. He investigates the practices of Indian yogis and fakirs, particularly their trance states or mental 'hibernation', in which some can be buried alive for days.</p>
                        <p>Experimenting on his friends, Braid discovers that he can induce deep trances by simple mental techniques: suggestion, controlled breathing and focussed attention.</p>
                        <p>Braid announces that there is no longer any need to believe in animal magnetism, occult powers or vital energies. Trance states, and all the mysterious phenomena they generate, can be produced by the mind alone. </p>
                        <p>He coins a new term for the process: hypnotism.</p>
