                        <p>Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud publish the sensational case of Anna O - the pseudonym of a brilliant and fragile young woman with baffling physical and mental symptoms. She suffered from chronic coughing, hallucinations, paralysis, loss of vision, and even forgot how to speak her native German.</p>

                        <p>Anna appeared to have a separate personality, only accessible under trance. When hypnotised, she began to reveal traumatic incidents that were beyond the reach of her normal memory.</p>
