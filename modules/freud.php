                        </header>

                        <p>1895, Vienna: Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud publish the case of Anna O - the pseudonym of a brilliant and fragile young woman with baffling physical and mental symptoms. She suffered from chronic coughing, hallucinations, paralysis, loss of vision, and even forgot how to speak her native German.</p>

                        <p>Like the Okey sisters, Trilby and Gabrielle Bompard, Anna appeared to have two separate personalities, one of which was only accessible under trance. When Breuer hypnotised her, she recalled traumatic incidents that were beyond the reach of her normal memory. </p>

                        <p>Breuer claimed that as she recalled each buried event to consciousness and recognised it, the physical symptom associated with it disappeared.</p>

                        <p>Freud and Breuer concluded that the mind had the power to create physical illnesses – and also to heal them. </p>

                        <p>Anna O christened Freud and Breuer’s method ‘the talking cure’. Her crippling afflictions had grown from a mental distress she had been unable to confront, or even consciously recognise.</p>

                        <p>Under her real name, Bertha Pappenheim, she became a pioneering social worker, author and campaigner for education and women’s rights. Her identity as Anna O was only revealed after her death.</p>
