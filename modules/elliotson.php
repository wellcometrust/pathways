                </header>

                <p class="intro-text">60 years after Mesmer in Paris, mesmerism has hit Victorian Britain. Dr John Elliotson, based at University College Hospital London, is holding dramatic demonstrations of his supposed mesmeric powers that draw the likes of Dickens, Faraday, &c.</p>p
                <p class="intro-text">In 1838 he demonstrates his mesmeric control over Elizabeth and Jane Okey, two young servant girls who he has been treating for epileptic seizures. They are shortly to become celebrities. </p>

                    </header>

                    <p>The Okey sisters are extraordinarily susceptible, slipping rapidly into trance states where they manifest quite different personalities. Elliotson can make them fall into stupor merely by waving a finger.</p>
                    <p>Touching magnetised metals or even water sends them into a trance in which they spontaneously mirror each other’s actions.</p>
                   <!--  <img src="../_assets/img/elliotson/demonstration1.jpg"> -->
                    <p>Elliotson’s demonstrations are crowded with doctors, dignitaries and luminaries. The Okey sisters seem to enjoy the attention, especially in their disinhibited trance states, when they tease the gentlemen and sit in their laps.</p>
                    <p>However, even in the very first demonstration something seems awry. Elliotson can’t get <del>xxx</del> Okey to come out of her mesmerised state – and it is only when her demand that Dr Wood, Elliotson’s assistant, rubs her neck is met, that she surfaces. Some people become suspicious&hellip;</p>
