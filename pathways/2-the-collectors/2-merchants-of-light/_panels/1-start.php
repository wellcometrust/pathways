        <p class="intro-text">In seventeenth-century philosopher Francis Bacon’s futuristic 1627 novel New Atlantis, sailors aboard a Spanish ship journeying from Peru to China inadvertently discovered ‘a fair city’ on the South Sea island of Bensalem. The isolated community is free from pollution or foulness and has access to mechanical arts, precious stones and engine-houses unknown to the visiting Europeans.</p>
