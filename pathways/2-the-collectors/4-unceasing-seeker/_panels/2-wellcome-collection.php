                </header>
                <p>Many of Henry Wellcome’s earliest acquisitions were books full of design ideas he and his staff could apply to the pharmaceutical products and marketing materials of Burroughs Wellcome & Co. He also collected containers that might provide visual inspiration for the company’s packaging, and decorated his business offices with hunting trophies, works of art and literature.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Collecting offered Wellcome, a businessman from the American mid-West, a path towards scholarly respect and recognition within London society. In the 1890s he conceived a plan to research and publish an encyclopaedic book, a chronicle of human ingenuity that would document the use of animal products in medicine from antiquity to contemporary times. His ambitious aim would be achieved by collecting books and artefacts and empirically testing the chemistry of various substances.</p>

                </header>
                <p>With an unceasing zeal for collecting, Wellcome bought objects and publications from bazaars, bookshops, pharmacies, dealers and private collectors. He employed a network of agents to purchase items under assumed names and engaged researchers to sift through the information they acquired. Stockpiling ideas as much as objects, Wellcome forbade his agents from making personal purchases and refused his researchers’ requests to investigate areas he intended to study himself.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Wellcome’s planned book never appeared. No sooner did he approve an acquisition, than he became distracted by the promise of something more interesting. Boxes and crates piled up in his archives and the preparation of the manuscript was endlessly postponed.</p>
                <p>As the collection expanded to include armour, weapons, medical equipment, amulets and even entire shops, Wellcome’s insatiable appetite for acquiring objects outweighed any inclination to sort, catalogue or even use the books regularly arriving in his stores. The focus of the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, which was used by researchers, missionaries and colonial travellers, was squarely on collecting – it was never opened to the general public (or ‘stragglers’, as Wellcome once labelled them) in Wellcome’s lifetime.</p>

                    <h1>5.	Ultimate recognition</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Wellcome famously described his plans as existing in his mind, ‘like a jigsaw puzzle, and gradually I shall be able to piece it together’. Although he never completed the research he likened to a ‘struggle for light’, Wellcome’s vision drove the eclectic growth of his collection for many years. Today, Wellcome Collection and the Wellcome Library still collect and present a broad interpretation of medical history.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, Wellcome obtained the recognition he so desperately craved: at the age of 79 he was made both a Knight of the realm and a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
