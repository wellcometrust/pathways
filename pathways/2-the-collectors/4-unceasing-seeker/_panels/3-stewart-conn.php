                <i>My plans exist in my mind like a jigsaw puzzle… and gradually I shall be able to piece it together</i>
                <p>Sir Henry Wellcome, 1853-1936</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As though a neolithic arrowhead he’d unearthed
            at the age of four had entered his bloodstream,
            its sliver of flint sparking an obsession, the items
            he acquired over the years ranged from Darwin’s
            whalebone walking-stick, Napoleon’s toothbrush
            and a pair of Florence Nightingale’s mocassins
            to shrunken heads and tons of ancient armour.</p>

            <p>But despite all his squirrelling, the museum
            to house them remained illusory. Picture him,
            his explorer’s garb and trappings laid aside,
            increasingly hemmed in, until overwhelmed
            by the mouldering mountain, moth-eaten,
            worm-ridden, filling his Willesden warehouse
            to overflowing, he ended up part haunted,
            part devoured by more than enough to fill five
            Louvres but not some insatiable chasm within.</p>

            <p>Garlanded and afforded the scholastic kudos
            he craved, a vast fortune securely amassed,
            did he at the last find respite from cupidity
            or in a lonely hall of mirrors cower from those
            behemoths hemming him in, their foetid breath?</p>
