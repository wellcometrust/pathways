        <p class="intro-text">From 1719, when you could view one of Italian surgeon Guillaume Desnoues’ anatomical wax models for a shilling, in a grocer’s shop on the Strand, Londoners were avid visitors to anatomical displays and shows. But by the 1870s all the city’s public anatomy museums had closed down, under accusations of obscenity and legal censure.</p>
