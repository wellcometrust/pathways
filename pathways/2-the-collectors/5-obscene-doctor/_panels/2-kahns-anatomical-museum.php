            <p>Like Rackstrows before it, visitors to self-styled ‘doctor’ Joseph Kahn’s anatomical museum on Oxford Street encountered a life-size anatomical Venus and shocking models of the pathology of venereal disease. They could view microscopic slides and listen to daily lectures about the ‘wondrous’ structure and function of the human body.</p>
            
            <p>Ladies were omitted only on specific days, when Kahn insisted the most offensive models were removed from display.</p>
