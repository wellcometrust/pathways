            <p>After the Duke of Buckinghamâ€™s murder, Tradescant installed all these rarities in his own family home and opened it to the public. Anyone with sixpence to spare might wonder at the hands of mermaids and mummies, a salamander, chameleon and pelican, a bat as large as a pigeon, a Madagascan dodo, a small piece of wood from the cross of Christ and much more.</p>
