        <p class="intro-text">In 1634, anyone who spent a day at John Tradescant’s house and garden in south Lambeth could discover more curiosities than a man might see in a lifetime of travel. A must-see attraction for half a century, Tradescant’s ‘Ark’ was destined to become the first museum in Britain.</p>
