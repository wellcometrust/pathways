            <p>When Buckingham died, Tradescant installed the collection of rarities in his new home in South Lambeth and opened it up to the public. Anyone who could afford the 6d entrance fee, to what became known as ‘Tradescant’s Ark’, could see hands of mermaids and mummies, a salamander, chameleon, pelican and remora, a bat as large as a pigeon, a Madagascan dodo, a small piece of wood from the cross of Christ, and more were all displayed.</p>
