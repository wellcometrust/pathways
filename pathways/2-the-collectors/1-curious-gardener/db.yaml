# Library Layer

# A resource example:
# -   type: book
#     thumb: image.jpg
#     title: The Commission’s report on Animal Magnetism
#     author: Benjamin Franklin
#     date: 1785
#     link: http://wellcomelibrary.org/package/b20595244
#
# A resource can have all the attributes, but some empty, or only the attributes it requires. It all works.
#
# A library item can have one of 5 types:
# - book
# - video
# - audio
# - document
# - image
#
# These just dictate which thumbnail fallback image it receives.
#
# Links to player resources are in the following format: http://wellcomelibrary.org/package/b20595244
# If copied from the site, it has 'player' in the link, which is wrong. Must be 'package'. And it doesn't need any cruft after the id.

    title: 'Merchants of Light'
    text: 'By the time Tradescant died in 1638, a new approach to collecting was emerging: not the gathering and display of eclectic and rare curiosities, but an ordered search for specimens that might be studied to understand the world. In one philosopher’s mind, the men building up such collections were nothing less than ‘merchants of light’.'
