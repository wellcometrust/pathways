# A resource example:
# -   type: book
#     thumb: image.jpg
#     title: The Commission’s report on Animal Magnetism
#     author: Benjamin Franklin
#     date: 1785
#     link: http://wellcomelibrary.org/package/b20595244
#
# A resource can have all the attributes, but some empty, or only the attributes it requires. It all works.
#
# A library item can have one of 5 types:
# - book
# - video
# - audio
# - document
# - image
#
# These just dictate which thumbnail fallback image it receives.
#
# Links to player resources are in the following format: http://wellcomelibrary.org/package/b20595244
# If copied from the site, it has 'player' in the link, which is wrong. Must be 'package'. And it doesn't need any cruft after the id.

    title: 'Credits'
    text: 'By opening up the ‘locked cabinet’ of sexual knowledge to a mass audience, Stopes unintentionally built up a collection of deeply personal correspondence. These confessional and emotional letters illustrate the appetite for – and impact of – the information Stopes once again exposed to the public.'
