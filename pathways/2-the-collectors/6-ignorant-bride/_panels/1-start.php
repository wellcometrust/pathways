        <p class="intro-text">Brilliant young paleobotanist Marie Stopes was so ignorant about the workings of the human body that she claimed not to realise her own marriage was unconsummated. After she learned the truth and shared her findings in a best-selling book, Stopes inadvertently became a collector of personal stories about sex and marriage.</p>
