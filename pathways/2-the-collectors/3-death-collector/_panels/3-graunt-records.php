            <p>Graunt collected a few ‘scattered bills’ and began tabulating the data they shared. Like a merchant’s account book, Graunt’s tables provide a continuous record of additions and subtractions to the City’s population.</p>
            <p>Graunt also interpreted the information he collected, documenting insights about the causes and trends behind the changing market for trade.</p>
