            <p>In a city still reeling from the massive loss of life caused by the great Plague, each time a Londoner died a bell tolled to summon ‘the Searchers’, matronly (and often drunken) women who  viewed the corpse and made any other necessary enquiries in order to establish the cause of death. Within days this information appeared in the ‘Bills of Mortality’, published each week and sold on subscription for 4 shillings a year. Until they peaked Graunt’s interest, the Bills weren’t used for much more than feeding ghoulish gossip.</p>
