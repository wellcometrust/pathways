        <p class="intro-text">Mesmerism is still being spread by a network of believers. Its most prominent champion in Britain is Dr John Elliotson, professor at University College Hospital.</p>
        <p class="intro-text">His dramatic demonstrations of mesmeric powers draw the likes of Charles Dickens and Michael Faraday. His prize subjects are Elizabeth and Jane Okey, two young servant girls who he has been treating for epileptic seizures.</p>
