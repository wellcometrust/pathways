            <h1>The curious case of Anna&nbsp;O</h1>
        </header>

        <p>In 1895 Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud published the case of Anna O: the pseudonym of a brilliant and fragile young woman with baffling physical and mental symptoms. She suffered from chronic coughing, hallucinations, paralysis, loss of vision, and even forgot how to speak her native German.</p>
        <p>When hypnotised, she was able to recall traumatic incidents that were beyond the reach of her normal memory. As she recalled each buried event to consciousness, the physical symptom associated with it disappeared.</p>
        <p>Freud and Breuer concluded that the mind had the power to cause physical illnesses â€“ and also to heal them.</p>
