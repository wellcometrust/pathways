        <p>Freud installed a couch in his consulting room to hypnotise his patients. He soon abandoned the technique, finding that it imposed too much control. For the cure to work, patients had to solve their own riddles themselves.</p>
        <p>He replaced hypnosis with ‘free association’, but he kept the couch.</p>
