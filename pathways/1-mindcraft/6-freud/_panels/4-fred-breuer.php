        <p>Anna O christened Freud and Breuer’s method ‘the talking cure’. Her crippling afflictions had grown from a mental distress she had been unable to confront or even consciously recognise.</p>
        <p>Under her real name, Bertha Pappenheim, she became a pioneering social worker, author and campaigner for education and women’s rights. Her identity as Anna O was only revealed after her death.</p>
