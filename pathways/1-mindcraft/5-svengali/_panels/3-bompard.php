                    <h1>Murder under hypnosis</h1>
                    <p>Du Maurier's novel reflected sensational true-life stories, such as the case of Gabrielle Bompard in Paris in 1889. On trial for murder, Gabrielle claimed she had been hypnotised by her male accomplice and had no memory of the crime.</p>
                    <p>At her trial, expert witnesses disputed the power of hypnosis. Could it be used to make someone commit murder against their will, or without their knowledge?</p>
