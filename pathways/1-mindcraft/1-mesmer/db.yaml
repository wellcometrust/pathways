# A resource example:
# -   type: book
#     thumb: image.jpg
#     title: The Commission’s report on Animal Magnetism
#     author: Benjamin Franklin
#     date: 1785
#     link: http://wellcomelibrary.org/package/b20595244
#
# A resource can have all the attributes, but some empty, or only the attributes it requires. It all works.
#
# Links to player resources are in the following format: http://wellcomelibrary.org/package/b20595244
# If copied from the site, it has 'player' in the link, which is wrong. Must be 'package'. And it doesn't need any cruft after the id.
