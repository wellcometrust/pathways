<p class="no-indent">Dear Doctor, </p>
<p><span class="audio-transcript">I am writing to you for your kind advice, as I am very worried, the man I marrying this year had an accident a few weeks ago and while I was helping to remove his bloodstained and torn clothes, I couldn’t help but see that his sex organs were very large, and the thought of marital relations has worried me since as I myself am quite small in that respect. Could you advise me in any way, or suggest anything to help me out.</span> I’m a pure girl, and would be grateful if you would tell me plainly, as I’ve no mother or sister to ask about this matter, and I don’t like to ask friends, or they may think I’m too fast. If you will answer to the address given, I will call for it my next day out. </p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>ASG </p>
