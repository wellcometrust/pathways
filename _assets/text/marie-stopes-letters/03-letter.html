<p>In what you say about coition during pregnancy is your reference to the example of animals quite sufficient as it stands? The male animal resorts freely to other females; may not your words be perverted as pointing men in that direction? If the husband stands by the bedside and the wife lies across it he may get a moderate coition without exciting her, and I don’t think she is reluctant. Of course he will use the most extreme tenderness and consideration for her, and not go on too long. I don’t think you say anything about the narrow separate beds which have been introduced in England from continental countries; I don’t see how they can allow of comfortable positions, but we have never used them.  </p>
