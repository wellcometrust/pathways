<p>I am writing to you for your kind advice, as I am very worried, the man I marrying this year had an accident a few weeks ago and while I was helping to remove his bloodstained and torn clothes, I couldnâ€™t help but see that his sex organs were very large, and the thought of marital relations has worried me since as I myself am quite small in that respect. Could you advise me in any way, or suggest anything to help me out.</p>
