<p>I am not learned or influential yet I felt that I must to tell you how charmed and interested I was with you (sic) delightful Book (Married Love); and will offer my own experience for what it is worth – with the most unreserved candour. </p>
<p>It makes one wish that physicians could only make mankind in the mass comprehend and actually realize how much they are losing by continuing to cultivate the <em>artificial</em> rather than the <em>natural</em> and the real in daily life – which might be made as fair as the Garden of the Lord. </p>
<p> Parents confusing “ignorance” with “innocence” are eternally threatening their daughters in the belief that ignorance combined with fear will safeguard their chastity. This is very far from the case. </p>
<p>Girls today have so much liberty as well as independence (financially) that in their ignorance despite their fears, they will all ultimately go to the limit where the opportunity offers and the impulse moves them – to make an <em>original discovery</em> each for herself. </p>
<p>Hence “propriety” allied to ignorance has much to answer for; scores of girls are daily injuring their health with drugs and quacks when candour and kindness would save them untold soul anguish and hopeless despair. </p>
