<p>My youth was spoilt by learning a horrid vice, which at 16 I realised was bad and endeavoured with poor success to cure by penances such as eating no sugar for a week, praying for hours, throwing all my cash into poor boxes etc. I managed it by 18 but thought I was done for, I never “fell” and was painfully nervous at marriage so that I prematurely ejaculated. My wife was very sensible and patient so that in the end we synchronised, the happiest moment in my life, I had been so frightened by silly stories!</p>
