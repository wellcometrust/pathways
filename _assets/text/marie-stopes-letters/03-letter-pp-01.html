<p>Dear Madam,  </p>
<p>As you refer in your important book “Married Love” to the question of positions I think that as one who has had more than twenty years of unusually happy married life I may be allowed a few words of supplement to what you have written, and you will use your own judgment as to making any use of them in view of the reticence which is desirable on this delicate subject. </p>
<p class="no-indent">I don’t think the experience of the lady who told you she felt almost suffocated each time can be exceptional. I myself know of an unusually lovely young wife saying she wished her husband was not so heavy, and the legal term “feme covert” for a married woman points to old custom. Yet it is shocking to think of her delicate body being strained and pinned down under a heavy man, and it is both foolish and needless. My bride soon found the right position and it is so absolutely comfortable for both that we have never had any other. I lie on my back, she lies upon me with her left leg between mine and my left between hers. Then I turn partly on my right side and wattle cosily into the position evidently intended by nature. The lady is in the position of honour on a sort of throne, and as she can talk as well as move freely there is no risk of her being left nervy and as you say in the air through premature ejaculation. And when all is over both relax without change of position and even without withdrawal into the greatest and most refreshing sleep. A letter such as a I understand you to refer to without disapproval is used when conception is deliberately desired by both.
<span class="audio-transcript">In what you say about coition during pregnancy is your reference to the example of animals quite sufficient as it stands? The male animal resorts freely to other females; may not your words be perverted as pointing men in that direction? If the husband stands by the bedside and the wife lies across it he may get a moderate coition without exciting her, and I don’t think she is reluctant. Of course he will use the most extreme tenderness and consideration for her, and not go on too long. I don’t think you say anything about the narrow separate beds which have been introduced in England from continental countries; I don’t see how they can allow of comfortable positions, but we have never used them.  </span></p>
<p> yours sincerely  </p>
<p> A happy husband and father.</p>
