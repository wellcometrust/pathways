<p class="no-indent">Since her birth I have had no actual connections with my wife as I feel I could not be her lover to give her all the pain again she has had with the three children that never lived. She too has no further desire for children. We have the joy however of married life. I give to my dear wife the pleasure that I have. I play with her with my fingers whilst she holds my person. After reading your book however I feel that we are doing wrong and that we shall suffer later, and I am at a loss as to my duty.</p>
