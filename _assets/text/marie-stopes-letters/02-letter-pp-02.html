<p>My own experience however has, though quite unconventional, been exactly the oppose – <em>radiantly happy</em> for <em>ten years past. </em> </p>

<p>About ten years ago I was a Bachelor Girl of Seventeen and until then had a Girl Roommate of similar age.   </p>

<p>Shortly afterwards by chance (or mischance) in the holiday time as Easter (though Autumn, it like a second Spring) I met, travelling, by train a young man rather older than myself; and quite unaccountably owing to some strange and spontaneous impulse he completely won my girlish heart.      </p>

<p>Being lonely weary and inexperienced I vaguely yearned for intimate companionship such as I had never known before; and though I was shy and timid yet he somehow irresistibly drew me to him.     </p>

<p>He wandered far along the sea beach to a remote secluded spot – and the very light of Heaven seemed to down upon us; we were enchanted – enraptured!    Then we entered a cave close by and felt completely isolated from the whole world, remote as my lover and I his Sweetheart quite automatically as if it had all been foreordained.</p>

<p>He treated me gracefully, tenderly, affectionately and I had no fear nor shame – for I permitted him without a murmur to admire me as well as the dainty lingerie I was wearing, even my immature girlish bosoms; and in a heavenly trance I kissed him fondly when he pressed his lips to mine.</p>
