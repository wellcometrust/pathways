<p class="no-indent"><span class="audio-transcript">that we are doing wrong and that we shall suffer later, and I am at a loss as to my duty.</span> I am not putting my name to this letter but perhaps you will deal with the matter in the next book you write on the subject. I shall watch for its publication. I read the Daily Mail each day so perhaps you will see that your publishers advertise it in that paper. Your notes on page 21. Are very true. My wife loves me to kiss and feel her breasts. Sometimes (in a very shy way) she will push my head lower until my lips touch her entrance – I have kissed her there that she has afterwards hugged me from joy. It is only at times that this happens. oh what bodily thrills we have both felt. No other woman do I want but my dear wife. </p>
<p>These are very badly written notes but the subject is a difficult one to write upon and you are to be congratulated on your lovely book.  I have written this without the knowledge of my wife. Again thanking you </p>
<p>Yours very sincerely, </p>
<p><em>A loving husband </em></p>
