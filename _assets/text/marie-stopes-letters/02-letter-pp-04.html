<p>For to this present day, each weekend in the summer season we together like young lovers make our pleasurable pilgrimage to our enchanted cave – to still experience all our original youthful happiness and ecstasy; and when I look around and see the faces of my married Girl friends I am continually forced to the conclusion that their happiness ended with the honeymoon or before. </p><p>And whatever economic expediency may demand Marriage as a public utility or necessity – I have long felt convinced that marriage may have been made for Man, but Man was certainly not made for Marriage; <em>nor Woman either. </em></p><p>Woman under the guise of Holy Matrimony has long been the victim of domestic vulgarity, brutality, and even immorality.</p><br><p>In conclusion, it is the ardent wish of us both to have such a Baby as you describe; and as I lie in bed upon a Sunday morning for an extra hour or so to exchange congenial caresses with my Lover – I yearn for the moment when I shall receive his welcome embrace and we shall be joined together in the <em>Supreme</em> and <em>Sacred Act</em> of <em>Creation.  </em></p>
