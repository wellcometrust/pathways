00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.230
Well the actual facts in the 'Anna O' case 
are disputed to put it mildly, 
 
2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.220
but it became the great illustration 
of the new model of the mind,

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.130
because like the Okey Sisters, 
like Trilby, like Gabrielle Bompard,

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.100
Anna seems to have two 
completely separate personalities. 

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.180
And a lot of doctors had speculated 
that there must be 

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.150
some physical cause for this, 
some brain defect perhaps. 

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.030
But what Freud argued, was that these 
two apparently separate personalities 

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.140
were actually an unconscious way 
of dealing with trauma,

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.140
and that once that trauma 
was recalled to consciousness 

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.010
they could be brought into dialogue, 

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.090
and the rift between them 
could be healed.
