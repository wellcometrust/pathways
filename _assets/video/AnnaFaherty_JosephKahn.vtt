00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.060
Joseph Kahn wasn’t taken to court for 
displaying ‘obscene’ objects or images. 

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.010
At the time, viewing anatomical 
collections like Kahn’s

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.170
was an accepted, interesting,  
educational pursuit for the public. 

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.180
In 1853 the editor of The Lancet, Thomas Wakley, 
had only one complaint about Kahn’s exhibition, 

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.170
and that was that sometimes 
ladies were admitted.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.020
Kahn was taken to court instead because
when he found himself in financial difficulties 

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.000
he got into partnership with a quack business.

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.220
Today, we think of quacks as people 
operating outside orthodox Western medicine.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.130
That wasn’t always the case. 

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.230
In the 1800s, many quacks adhered to 
the principles of conventional medicine. 

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.050
Their remedies might not work, 
but conventional ones might not either.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.090
What the medical establishment 
was more concerned about

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170
was that quacks were exploiting the sick, 
and sometimes the well,

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.120
using smart marketing tactics 
to part them from their cash. 

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.150
Of course, persuading somebody to buy something 
they don’t really need isn’t strictly illegal. 

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.200
So it wasn’t until the Obscene Publications Act became law 
in 1857 that they could do much about this.

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.070
The Act wasn’t just used to prosecute people 
hawking pornographic images. 

18
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.000
It could be applied in any situation where 
the public was in danger of being corrupted.

19
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.230
Kahn’s publications that included advertisements 
for treatments for venereal disease, fell into this category.

20
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.210
Reporting on the successful prosecution brought by 
the ‘Society for the Suppression of Vice’, 

21
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.130
The Lancet completely changed its tune.

22
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.150
They described Kahn’s displays 
as 'obscene and disgusting'.

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.120
And as further prosecutions were brought against 
other public anatomy collections across the country, 

24
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
the idea of exploring the 
wonder of the human body

25
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.020
transformed from acceptable, 
educational entertainment

26
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.050
to a shameful taboo.
