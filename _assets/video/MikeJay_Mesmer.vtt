00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.080
So the French Academy of Sciences convened a
committee to investigate the claims of animal magnetism, 

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.190
with very distinguished figures including 
Benjamin Franklin, Antoine Lavoisier and so on.

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.110
They witnessed lots of magnetic séances, 
they saw lots of people having convulsions,

4
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.210
they experimented on themselves, 
they had themselves mesmerised

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.150
– some of them felt something, 
and some of them didn’t. 

6
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.220
And then they ran a whole series of 
blind experimental trials,

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.040
where they had one object magnetised 
– a cup, for example – 

8
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.140
and placed it among a load of other objects, 
to see if people who were under   

9
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.230
the magnetic influence could tell 
which one it was coming from.

10
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.020
And what they established pretty rapidly 
was that magnetised subjects couldn’t   

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.170
distinguish which object had been 
magnetised and which hadn’t,

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240
that the effect was all in the mind, 

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.160
or as they put it in the final 
concluding paragraph of their report:

14
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.240
“the imagination, without magnetism, 
can produce convulsions; 

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.190
but magnetism without the imagination 
can produce nothing”.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.120
So that seemed to be a pretty definitive judgement,

17
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.170
but actually it left a crucial question open: 

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.230
if animal magnetism was all 
in the imagination,

19
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.140
did that mean that the effects weren’t real? 

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.190
Or, did it mean that the imagination 

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.160
was actually a much more powerful force
than anyone had considered?
