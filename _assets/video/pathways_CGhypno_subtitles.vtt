00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.110
Right, try a little technique with me.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.180
It’s very, very straightforward.

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.220
Clasp your hands together,

4
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.060
like your making a desperate prayer,
thumbs crossed.

5
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.030
And then open these two fingers,

6
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.050
and stare at the gap
in-between your fingers.

7
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.190
And notice that the gap
is getting smaller and smaller.

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.010
It’s getting smaller because your
fingers want to close.

9
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.150
You are powerless to stop them.

10
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.040
You can try and struggle but you can’t
because they are going to close,

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.160
Those fingers are going to close
- I hope you are trying this.

12
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.150
Try it and you’ll notice that sooner or later
they are going to close.

13
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.050
When they close, close your eyes.

14
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.080
Take a deep breath...

15
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.180
and just give yourself the thought...

16
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.190
How would it be, if... ?
