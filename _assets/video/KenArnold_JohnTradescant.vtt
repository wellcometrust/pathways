00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.190
I think it’s quite hard for us to imagine now

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.220
just how exciting the work of John Tradescant 
was in the early 17th century. 

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.100
We’re of course surrounded by museums 
on every other street corner

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.030
but in his time he was really creating 
an entirely new institution,

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.120
borrowed from ideas that were current in 
Renaissance Italy and elsewhere in Europe

6
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.020
and he had this sense that he 
could bring representative samples

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.160
of the material world in his garden 
and his house

8
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.030
and that would almost be a 
microcosm of the entire world.

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.030
These objects weren’t common, 
they weren’t objects that were already in England,

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.020
many of them were brought from 
overseas by explorers, 

11
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.110
by ship’s captains, by merchants. 

12
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.060
There was a whole sense that the world’s stuff 
was arriving on the shores of England 

13
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.010
and Tradescant was there to set-up a little enclave, 
a little place where you could 

14
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
come and visit and see all these exquisite, 
extraordinary unusual things.

15
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.170
And they weren’t just the things that 
we already have in our lives. 

16
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.110
There was a sense in which there 
was still a magic about them. 

17
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.120
There was a correspondence between some of 
these objects and some things in us 

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
- that walnuts looked like brains, 
that bloodstone looked like our blood,

19
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.200
and therefore this wasn’t just a museum 
of things that were in people’s lives, 

20
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.090
it was a museum of the entire world 
and one almost pulsing with

21
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.130
the excitement of giving people 
insight into the entire universe. 

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.160
One of the fascinating things about 
collections is not only what is in them, 

23
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.040
but who’s allowed to see them, who owns them,

24
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.060
who shares in the pleasure and 
the knowledge of looking at them. 

25
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.080
Broadly speaking, the history of collecting 

26
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.020
started at the elites, 
started with princes and kings, 

27
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.010
and then was broadened out into merchants,

28
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.050
into people who were voyaging abroad making 

29
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.160
a career out of being involved in this stuff.

30
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.010
And then eventually that sense in which it 
begins to belong to all of us 

31
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.010
- that all of us might though public 
institutions have access to it.

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.120
But there is, behind all that, there’s 
always going to be a politics of access, 

33
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.100
a politics of who gets to see it, 
and even in our own time we can 

34
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.060
think of moments when knowledge almost
has been privatised,

35
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.140
where it seems as though we’re interested 
in restricting who has access to that collection 

36
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.200
- that’s an ongoing theme in being 
interested in the history of these objects.
