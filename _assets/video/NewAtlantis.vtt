00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.170
Sailor: We sailed from Peru, 
for China and Japan, by the South Sea.

2
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.050
Finding ourselves in the greatest 
wilderness of waters in the world, 

3
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.170
we gave ourselves for lost men 
and prepared for death.

4
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.070
It seemed that we had before us 
a picture of our salvation in Heaven;

5
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
we entered into a good haven, 
being the port of a fair city.

6
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.000
Governor: I am by ofﬁce governor of this House.

7
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.170
Some things I may tell you, which I think 
you will not be unwilling to hear.

8
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.150
We of this island know well most of the 
habitable world, and are ourselves unknown.

9
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.190
We have twelve fellows that sail into foreign countries, 
under the names of other nations, (for our own we conceal); 

10
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.190
who bring us the books and experiments of all other parts.

11
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.230
These we call Merchants of Light.

12
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.060
There is word come that one these fellows 
will be here this day seven-night: 

13
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.130
we have seen none of them this dozen years…

14
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.240
We have engine-houses, where are prepared engines 
and instruments for all sorts of motions.

15
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.230
We also have some degrees of ﬂying in the air.

16
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.200
We have large orchards and gardens; 
in these we make plants rise without seeds.

17
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.180
Likewise we make beasts differ in many ways.

18
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.090
We have perspective-houses, where we make 
demonstrations of all lights and radiations;

19
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.100
and also have shops of medicines; in so much 
greater variety than you have in Europe.

20
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.010
Lastly, we have consultations, which 
of the inventions shall be published, 

21
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.090
and which not: and take all an oath of secrecy,

22
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.180
these are the riches of Salomon’s House. 

23
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I give thee leave to publish it for 
the good of all other nations; 

24
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.170
for we here are in a land unknown.
