Hypnosis is used to deal with pain in two ways. 

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.130
One is very intense, dramatic situations
like an operation or dentistry. 

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.240
A lot of dentists are trained in hypnotherapy 

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.110
to help you manage that intense pain 
while having a procedure.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.190
There are places around the world 

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.050
where you can have hypnosis instead of anaesthesia, 

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.130
which sounds really hardcore, but

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.230
there is a huge efficacy rate, 
so there must be something in it.

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.180
It's also used in a more subtle way

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.220
to deal with chronic, ongoing pain.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.060
It's the basis of mindfulness in fact,

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.110
which was developed at the 
University of Massachusetts 

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.120
just to help people reframe their
relationship with pain.  

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.240
So instead of becoming tense or
uptight about ongoing pain 

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.040
you actually look at, 'can I 
cope with it in this moment'? 

16
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.120
And you deal with it on a moment
by moment basis

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.020
and that really has a huge efficacy 
rate in reducing people's 

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.140
attitudes to pain and
improving their lives.
