## Pathways - A guide

The pathways project is a sort of 'short-form journalism' partially inspired by the NYTimes long-form journalism pieces.
A 'Pathway' is a collection of, usually, around 5 or 6 stories/modules. Each module is made up of panels, each being, in effect, a chapter/scene.

Each module has an introductory starting panel, followed a sequence of 1 or more panels which cross fade between each other and perform actions, then end with the library layer and teaser for the next module.

## Creating a Pathway

In the folder, /pathways there is a folder, `x-example`. Copy this folder and then rename it by incrementing the previous pathways' number and then providing the name of the new pathway, e.g. `3-breath`
